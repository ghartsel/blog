title: "Documentation, the Good Parts"
subtitle: >
    Can a handful of writing tips improve your software documentation skills by an order of magnitude?
description: >
    As a developer, you understand what you've created better than anybody else, and now you need to transfer
    that knowledge to other developers who want to use your software. The problem is that documentation takes
    time you don't have and effective communication takes skills that aren't integral to what you do.
    Sure, you can read the occasional Hacker News article on what makes good technical writing, take one of the
    online Technical Writing Courses (like the one from Google: https://developers.google.com/tech-writing), and
    get AI to do the writing for you, but unless writing is your day job, the skills aren't going to stick. It's
    going to be a slog and writing will still feel like rolling a boulder uphill—you'll hate it. Tools like
    Grammarly and style checkers will help but that's not where the problem is. Can a few writing tips that focus
    on the core elements of good writing make your writing (almost) on par with that of a professional tech
    writer? Better, because you understand what you're writing about? Can they help you transfer that knowledge
    to documentation that's both effective and considerate of your users' time? You bet they can because they
    embody powerful concepts and are easy to remember, and that's a good thing.

Doing anything well is hard. Writing well is hard. Being a 1% programmer is hard. You might have to be born with it to have the ingrained or tacit know-how needed to make the work seem effortless although it will still be hard. On the other hand, anybody can write, right?

Maybe they can't or choose not to. So how do you create documentation that isn't labor-intensive, tedious, and frustrating to create or read? How can you make the hard work easier without exceptional talent or unlimited time? A few industry-proven techniques can consistently produce great docs if not exceptional docs.

Along the way you'll get some opionated insights from personal experience on what works and what doesn't—but let's focus on the basics.

"Spatial adjacency is more powerful than temporal stacking.”

{{< blockquote author="Edward Tufte" cite="" >}}
Spatial adjacency greatly reduces the memory problems associated with making comparisons of small amounts of information stacked in time.

## Topics as Structure

Topic-oriented doccumentation defines conceptual and procedural topics to build its structure. In 2005, the [Darwin Information Typing Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture) was published to help authors create topic-based structured content. The standard is managed by the Organization of the Advancement of Structured Information Standards DITA Technical Committee.

## Teach Don't Tell—Minimalism

Now, some learning theory.

Following the technology revolution of the 1990s, technical communicators were employed to convey technical information to the new, rapidly growing population of technical users. This began with the use of manuals, but those were not widely well received as did not meet the accelerated speed at which the users desired information. In 1998, John M. Carroll developed the writing concept of [minimalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism_(technical_communication)) which provided shorter and more streamlined instruction for the user to access quickly. The essence of minimalist theory is that if you give the learner less (less to read, less overhead, less to get tangled in), the learner will achieve more (Carroll, 1984)

The 4 principles

### First principle—Choose an action-oriented approach

Allow learners to start immediately on meaningful tasks.

### Second principle—Anchor the tool in the task domain

Minimize the amount of reading and other passive forms of training by allowing users to fill in the gaps themselves

### Third principle—Support error recognition and recovery

Include error recognition and recovery activities in the instruction

### Fourth principle—Support reading to do, study, and locate

Make all learning activities self-contained and independent of sequence.

## More Complications

- Meaning and/or usability obscured by choice of structure
- Including a new idea of less importance (distraction)
- Failure to identify target audience

    - User vs. Maintainer
    - Beginner vs. Advanced
